# ExtraLifeStreamer
A set of donation tools for streaming during Extra Life.

Each component in this project is intended to be added to streaming software, such as OBS or XSplit, as an overlay enhancement. A component consists of an HTML file that can be added to a scene as a browser source. These components are built to be as user-friendly as possible; detailed instructions will be written soon.

Components currently include the following:
* GoalMeter: a colorful meter showing funds raised towards the participant's goal.
* DonationList: a list of donations and their donors.

These modules will be expanded, and new ones will be added as time allows.
