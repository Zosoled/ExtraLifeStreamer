# Contributing to ExtraLifeStreamer
Thanks for your interest! You must be really awesome to consider improving this little tool! This is a simple pet project of mine, so having anyone want to help means I must have done a decent job, I suppose.

## Issue Tracking
I'm always looking for new techniques to learn and cool features to implement, so if you find bugs or simply have ideas, I encourage you to create issues for them!

## Code Contributions
This code is available under the [GNU Public License](LICENSE), so feel free to fork and play. I started this project to improve my own Javascript skills and fill a feature gap in Extra Life streaming tools (namely, a fundraising goal meter). Any contributions would likewise have to offer me a learning opportunity to be considered for merging.
